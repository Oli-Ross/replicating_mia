# Replicating the membership inference attack

This repository contains my work on replicating the original paper of the 
[membership inference attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05820) 
against machine learning classifiers.

## Documentation

Documentation is generated by [pdoc](https://pypi.org/project/pdoc/) and
published to https://oliverross.github.io/replicating_mia.

## Setup

A setup script is provided, which does:
* Download necessary datasets into `/data`
* Run tests
* Generate documentation into `/docs`

Invoke it with `python set_up.py`.
For more fine-grained control, see `python3 set_up.py -h`.
